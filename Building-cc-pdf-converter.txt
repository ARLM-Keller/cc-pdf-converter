Building CC PDF Converter
-------------------------

In order to build CC PDF Converter, you will need, in addition to the files in this source ZIP,
to download zlib and libpng from the following URLs:
http://www.zlib.org
http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/

There is also a fix for a bug in Redmon that prevents users from printing using the current User;
in order to use it, you must build remdon after downloading it from this link:
http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/redmon/
and replacing the redmon.c file from the sources. The fix has been reported to the redmon author and
will probably be added to the next release of the program.

Additionally, in order for CC PDF Converter to add copyright/license information into the PDF file,
we have made some additions to ghostscript PDF metadata creation function. In order to compile ghostscript
using the additions, download ghostscript from http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/ (we used build 9.05), and replace
the file(s) found in the ghostscript/src folder of the zip file.

The zlib and png libraries should reside in the folders named after them.

CC PDF Converter can be compiled using MSVC 2008 and MSVC 2010 (we used the compiler of 2008 as it supports Windows 2000, and the 2010 compliter does not).
